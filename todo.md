# Project Todo List

- [X] 001 Review and update requirements for standardized inputs
  - [X] Confirm 0-10 range for all scaled inputs
  - [X] Plan UI changes (slider, counter)
  - [X] Plan data normalization strategy (Map original 1-N to 0-10)
  - [X] Plan multi-model training (RF, XGB, LogReg)
  - [X] Plan ensemble/average result display (Average probability for 'High' class)
- [X] 002 Update assessment UI to slider and add counter
  - [X] Modify `questionnaire.html` to use sliders (0-10)
  - [X] Add question counter display
  - [X] Update JavaScript for slider input and counter
  - [X] Update `style.css` for sliders and counter
- [X] 003 Normalize and preprocess dataset for 0-10 range
  - [X] Update preprocessing script (`train_models_normalized.py`)
  - [X] Implement normalization/scaling for 0-10 range
  - [X] Ensure target encoding remains correct
  - [X] Split data
- [X] 004 Train Random Forest, XGBoost, and secondary model
  - [X] Install XGBoost library
  - [X] Train RF model on normalized data
  - [X] Train XGBoost model on normalized data
  - [X] Train third model (e.g., Logistic Regression/SVM) on normalized data
  - [X] Evaluate all models
- [X] 005 Ensemble model results and save all models
  - [X] Define ensemble strategy (Average probability for 'High' class)
  - [X] Save all trained models (RF, XGB, LR)
  - [X] Save scalers/encoders if used
- [X] 006 Update Flask app for multi-model predictions and display
  - [X] Update `routes.py` to load all models and scalers
  - [X] Process slider input (0-10)
  - [X] Apply normalization/scaling to user input
  - [X] Get predictions and probabilities from all models
  - [X] Calculate ensemble/average result
  - [X] Update `results.html` to display individual and ensemble results
- [X] 007 Validate multi-model predictions and ensemble output
- [ ] 008 Report and send updated app to user
